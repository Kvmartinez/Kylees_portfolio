### About Me 
I’m a Psychology major at Loyola University Maryland, working toward my Bachelor’s degree with the goal of becoming a therapist. I'm passionate about helping others and dedicated to understanding the mental and emotional needs of individuals and families.

What sets me apart is my strong organization, bilingual communication skills, and natural ability to connect with people. I pride myself on giving 110% to everything I do whether it’s in my academic work, personal goals, or professional growth.

Outside the classroom, I’m also a small business owner. As a licensed nail technician, I run my own nail business, where I manage both the creative and professional sides of the brand. From designing sets to scheduling appointments and building a social media presence, I’ve developed skills in time management, marketing, and client relations.

Balancing school and entrepreneurship has taught me how to stay focused, work hard, and keep growing. Everything I’m doing now is preparing me to be a compassionate, and well rounded therapist in the future.
